# Bank-Jersey-API
Bank Application - A Maven Web Service Project for a Online Bank Web Service API

Typically, for an Online banking system the requirement is a customer should be able to open an account (or multiple) and should be able do transactions (lodgement, transfer, withdrawal) and should be able to check the current balance.

We have named the project Bank, and the aim of the project is to design, develop and document Web API and to develop a Client that make use of the API as to allow the customer to use Online Banking.

The Web API will allow the customer to create an account with the bank (example: current or savings or both) and allow the customer to take advantage of the online banking services like checking current balance, withdraw, transfer and lodge money.

We will be developing the project using Jersey to develop a RESTFul Web API that will seamlessly expose data from the database which our Client will leverage and do http calls like GET, POST and DELETE and provide online banking functionality.
